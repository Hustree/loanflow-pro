## PRD Prompt

HELP ME MAKE A PRD FOR AN MVP FEATURE I'M LOOKING TO VIBE CODE FOR **REACT MVP LOAN APP**.

I'M LOOKING TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING **PASSKEY IMPLEMENTATION** WITH **ANDROID BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION** SUPPORT.  
THE CURRENT SYSTEM ALREADY HAS WEBAUTHN + PASSKEY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT NEEDS **ANDROID-SPECIFIC BIOMETRIC INTEGRATION**.  
EACH ANDROID DEVICE SHOULD SUPPORT **FINGERPRINT, FACE UNLOCK, AND IRIS SCANNING** (WHEN AVAILABLE).  

THE GOAL: GIVE ANDROID USERS A NATIVE, SEAMLESS BIOMETRIC EXPERIENCE THAT MATCHES **GOOGLE PAY, BANKING APPS, AND ANDROID SYSTEM AUTH**.  
DRILL DOWN FROM **DEVICE CAPABILITY DETECTION → BIOMETRIC ENROLLMENT → PASSKEY CREATION → AUTHENTICATION FLOW**,  
AND CLICK A BIOMETRIC METHOD TO VIEW ITS **DETAILS (STRENGTH, FALLBACK OPTIONS, SECURITY LEVEL)**.

WE SHOULD THINK THROUGH:
1) HOW TO DETECT ANDROID BIOMETRIC CAPABILITIES (PERF: HARDWARE CHECK, API SUPPORT, USER PREFERENCES).  
2) HOW TO INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING PASSKEY UI + BRANDING.  
3) HOW TO TRANSLATE CURRENT **`@simplewebauthn/browser`** INTO ANDROID-SPECIFIC BIOMETRIC PROMPTS.  
4) HOW THIS BIOMETRIC AUTH INTERACTS WITH EXISTING PASSKEY MANAGEMENT.

AND THEN PUT TEXT: **"EXAMPLE PRD LINKED IN DESCRIPTION."**

## Functional Requirements Table

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR001 | Android Biometric Detection | As an Android user, I want the app to detect my device's biometric capabilities so I know what authentication methods are available. | App detects fingerprint, face unlock, iris scanning capabilities; shows available methods in device info. |
| FR002 | Enhanced Android Device Detection | As a developer, I want better Android device identification so I can provide device-specific biometric prompts. | Enhanced `getDeviceInfo()` returns detailed Android biometric capabilities, Android version, security level. |
| FR003 | Android Biometric Enrollment Flow | As an Android user, I want to enroll my biometrics during passkey setup so I can use them for authentication. | During passkey registration, Android users get native biometric enrollment prompts (fingerprint, face, iris). |
| FR004 | Android-Specific Biometric Prompts | As an Android user, I want biometric prompts that match my device's native UI so the experience feels familiar. | Biometric prompts use Android's native design language, animations, and fallback options. |
| FR005 | Biometric Strength Assessment | As a user, I want to know the security level of my biometric method so I can make informed security decisions. | App displays biometric security level (Class 1, 2, or 3) based on Android Biometric API classification. |
| FR006 | Android Biometric Fallbacks | As an Android user, I need fallback options when biometrics fail so I can still access my account. | Fallback to device PIN, pattern, or password with clear error messages and recovery steps. |
| FR007 | Multi-Biometric Support | As an Android user with multiple biometrics, I want to use any enrolled method so I have flexibility. | Users can enroll and use multiple biometric methods (fingerprint + face unlock) on the same device. |
| FR008 | Android Security Level Integration | As a developer, I want to integrate with Android's security levels so I can enforce appropriate security policies. | App respects Android's BiometricManager.Authenticators constants and security classifications. |
| FR009 | PWA Biometric Support | As a mobile user, I want biometrics to work in the installed PWA so I have a native app experience. | Biometric authentication works seamlessly in PWA mode with proper Android integration. |
| FR010 | Biometric Performance Optimization | As a user, I need fast biometric authentication so the login process is smooth. | Biometric auth completes in < 500ms with proper caching and optimization for Android devices. |
| FR011 | Android Version Compatibility | As a developer, I want to support multiple Android versions so I can reach more users. | Support Android 9+ (API 28+) with graceful degradation for older versions. |
| FR012 | Biometric Security Validation | As a security team member, I want to validate biometric security so I can ensure compliance. | Integration with Android's BiometricManager for security validation and threat detection. |

```typescript
interface AndroidDeviceInfo extends DeviceInfo {
  // Existing fields
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'tablet';
  browser: string;
  os: string;
  deviceName: string;
  
  // New Android-specific fields
  androidVersion: string;           // "13", "14", etc.
  apiLevel: number;                 // 28, 29, 30, etc.
  biometricCapabilities: {

  };
  securityLevel: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH';
  biometricEnrolled: boolean;
  fallbackMethods: string[];        // ["PIN", "PATTERN", "PASSWORD"]
  hardwareBacked: boolean;          // Uses TEE/SE
}
```

**Enhanced Passkey Credential Schema**
```typescript
interface AndroidPasskeyCredential extends PasskeyCredential {
  // Existing fields
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  publicKey: string;
  credentialId: string;
  counter: number;
  deviceName: string;
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'desktop' | 'tablet';

- Parse Android version and API level for capability detection
- Use `BiometricManager.Authenticators` for security classification
- Integrate with existing WebAuthn flow for seamless passkey creation
- Store biometric metadata alongside passkey credentials
- Provide Android-native error handling and recovery flows

---

## UX / UI

- **Android Biometric Detection Screen:** Shows available biometric methods with security levels
- **Biometric Enrollment Flow:** Native Android prompts during passkey setup
- **Authentication Prompts:** Android-native biometric dialogs with brand integration
- **Device Management:** Enhanced Android device cards showing biometric capabilities
- **Security Settings:** Biometric strength indicators and fallback configuration
- **Error Handling:** Android-specific error messages with recovery actions

## Technical Implementation

### Android Biometric API Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced device detection
export class AndroidBiometricService {
  async checkBiometricCapabilities(): Promise<AndroidDeviceInfo> {
    // Check Android version and API level
    // Use BiometricManager.Authenticators constants
    // Detect hardware-backed security
    // Return comprehensive device info
  }
  
  async enrollBiometric(): Promise<BiometricEnrollmentResult> {
    // Trigger native Android biometric enrollment
    // Handle multiple biometric types
    // Validate security requirements
    // Return enrollment status
  }
  
  async authenticateWithBiometric(): Promise<BiometricAuthResult> {
    // Use Android's native biometric prompt
    // Handle different biometric types
    // Manage fallback flows
    // Return authentication result
  }
}
```

### WebAuthn Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced passkey service
export class EnhancedPasskeyService extends PasskeyService {
  async createAndroidPasskey(
    userId: string, 
    biometricType: string
  ): Promise<AndroidPasskeyCredential> {
    // Detect Android capabilities
    // Enroll biometric if needed
    // Create WebAuthn credential
    // Store enhanced metadata
    // Return Android-specific credential
  }
  
  async authenticateWithAndroidBiometric(
    credentialId: string
  ): Promise<AuthResult> {
    // Verify biometric capabilities
    // Trigger Android biometric prompt
    // Validate with WebAuthn
    // Update usage statistics
    // Return authentication result
  }
}
```

### Redux State Management
```typescript
// Enhanced passkey slice
interface PasskeyState {
  // Existing state
  isSupported: boolean;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  authenticationStep: string;
  
  // New Android-specific state
  androidCapabilities: AndroidDeviceInfo | null;
  biometricEnrollment: BiometricEnrollmentState;
  securityLevel: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH';
  availableBiometrics: string[];
  enrolledBiometrics: string[];
}
```

|----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Android 9 (Pie) | 28 | ⚠️ Basic | Fingerprint only | Limited API support |
| Android 10 | 29 | ✅ Enhanced | Fingerprint + Face | Improved biometrics |
| Android 11 | 30 | ✅ Full | All biometrics | Strong biometrics |
| Android 12 | 31 | ✅ Full | All + Strong | Enhanced security |

## Security Considerations

### Android Biometric Security Levels
- **Class 3 (Strong):** Hardware-backed, spoof-resistant
- **Class 2 (Weak):** Software-based, basic security
- **Class 1 (Convenience):** Minimal security, convenience only

### Threat Mitigation
- **Biometric Spoofing:** Use hardware-backed authentication when available
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** WebAuthn origin binding prevents interception
- **Device Theft:** Biometric + device PIN provides layered security
- **Brute Force:** Rate limiting and account lockout after failures
