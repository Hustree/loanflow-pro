# Redux Demo Script for Loan Management System

## 🎯 Overview
This demo showcases Redux implementation in our Loan Management System with full CRUD operations for Loans, Members, and Loan Products.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the application:**
```bash
npm start
```

2. **Navigate to Redux Demo:**
- Login first (any email/password works in demo mode)
- Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/redux-demo

3. **Install Redux DevTools:**
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/

## 📊 Redux Pattern Advantages

### 1. **Predictable State Management**
- Single source of truth (one store)
- State is read-only (immutable)
- Changes made with pure functions (reducers)

### 2. **Centralized State Logic**
```javascript
// All state logic in one place
const loanSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'loan',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addLoan: (state, action) => {
      // Centralized loan creation logic
    },
    updateLoanStatus: (state, action) => {
      // Centralized status update logic
    }
  }
})
```

### 3. **Time-Travel Debugging**
- Undo/Redo any action
- Inspect state at any point in time
- Export/Import state for debugging

### 4. **Component Decoupling**
```javascript
// Any component can access state
const loans = useAppSelector(state => state.loan.loans)
const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

// No prop drilling needed!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Store Structure
```
store/
├── store.ts          # Redux store configuration
├── hooks.ts          # Typed hooks (useAppSelector, useAppDispatch)
├── loanSlice.ts      # Loan CRUD operations
├── memberSlice.ts    # Member CRUD operations
└── loanProductSlice.ts # Product CRUD operations
```

### State Shape
```typescript
{
  loan: {
    loans: Loan[],
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: string | null
  },
  member: {
    members: Member[],
    selectedMember: Member | null,
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: string | null,
    searchQuery: string
  },
  loanProduct: {
    products: LoanProduct[],
    selectedProduct: LoanProduct | null,
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: string | null
  }
}
```

## 📝 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Loan Application CRUD

1. **CREATE - Add New Loan:**
   - Fill in borrower details
   - Set loan amount (e.g., ₱50,000)
   - Select loan type (Emergency/Salary/Others)
   - Choose term (12/24/36/48 months)
   - Click "Add Loan"
   - ✅ Watch Redux DevTools: `loan/addLoan` action dispatched

2. **READ - View Loans:**
   - All loans displayed in real-time
   - Status badges show current state
   - Reference numbers auto-generated

3. **UPDATE - Change Status:**
   - Click ✅ to approve loan
   - Click ❌ to reject loan
   - Add notes when prompted
   - ✅ Watch Redux DevTools: `loan/updateLoanStatus` action

4. **DELETE - Remove Loan:**
   - Click 🗑️ icon
   - Confirm deletion
   - ✅ Watch Redux DevTools: `loan/removeLoan` action

### Scenario 2: Member Management

1. **Add Member:**
   - Enter member details
   - Auto-assigns active status
   - Creates unique member ID

2. **Toggle Status:**
   - Click edit icon to toggle active/inactive
   - State updates immediately across app

3. **Link Loans:**
   - Members can have multiple loans
   - Loan count tracked automatically

### Scenario 3: Product Management

1. **View Default Products:**
   - Emergency Loan (1.5% interest)
   - Salary Loan (1.2% interest)
   - Multi-Purpose Loan (1.8% interest)

2. **Add Custom Product:**
   - Define interest rates
   - Set min/max amounts
   - Configure available terms

3. **Toggle Product Status:**
   - Activate/Deactivate products
   - Controls availability for new loans

## 🔍 Redux DevTools Features

### 1. **Action Inspector**
- See every action dispatched
- View action payload
- Track timing

### 2. **State Tree**
- Inspect current state
- Drill down into nested data
- Compare state changes

### 3. **Diff View**
- See what changed
- Before/After comparison
- Identify mutations

### 4. **Time Travel**
- Slider to move through actions
- Jump to any point in history
- Export/Import sessions

### 5. **Action Replay**
- Record user sessions
- Replay bug scenarios
- Share debugging sessions

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### Why Redux for Loan Management?

1. **Audit Trail**: Every action is logged
2. **Consistency**: Same data everywhere
3. **Debugging**: Easy to trace issues
4. **Scaling**: Add features without refactoring
5. **Testing**: Pure functions are easy to test

### Redux Toolkit Benefits
- Less boilerplate code
- Built-in DevTools support
- Immer for immutable updates
- TypeScript support out-of-box

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Slice Example
```typescript
export const loanSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'loan',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addLoan: (state, action) => {
      const newLoan = {
        ...action.payload,
        id: crypto.randomUUID(),
        ref: generateReferenceNumber(),
        status: 'pending',
        submissionDate: new Date()
      }
      state.loans.push(newLoan) // Immer handles immutability
    }
  }
})
```

### Component Usage
```typescript
function LoanList() {
  const loans = useAppSelector(state => state.loan.loans)
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
  
  const handleApprove = (id: string) => {
    dispatch(updateLoanStatus({ 
      id, 
      status: 'approved',
      notes: 'Approved by admin'
    }))
  }
  
  return (
    // Render loans
  )
}
```

## 📊 Performance Benefits

1. **Memoization**: Selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Normalized State**: Efficient data structure
3. **Middleware**: Async operations handled cleanly
4. **DevTools**: Performance profiling built-in

## 📹 Video Reference
Similar to the Pizza Shop demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_shA5Xwe8_4
But adapted for Loan Management System with:
- Loan applications instead of pizza orders
- Members instead of customers  
- Loan products instead of pizza types
- Approval workflow instead of delivery tracking
